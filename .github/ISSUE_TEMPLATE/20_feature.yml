      âš  **Most feature requests will be closed with little or no explanation.** Most assertion libraries tend to accrete 1000 `ShouldXyz` methods for every conceivable situation. This library refuses to "boil the ocean". Instead, this library provides a small core set of highly predictable assertions that is not expected to grow over time, and is instead meant to be augmented with the occasional custom assertion in your own code, perhaps writing those in terms of these fundamental core assertions. If that makes this project insufficient for your needs, we encourage you to reach for an alternative library with a larger scope.
